# Mobile Game A/B Testing
Used statistical exploration and modeling in Python to understand the difference in average player retentions (1 day and 7 days) against 2 different player levels. Used bootstrapping (with replacement) to better understand with confidence, the difference in means across the control and new group. Performed this same process (A/B testing) for customers with 1 day retention and 7 day retention respectively. 

Bootstrapping revealed that there is a significant difference in player retention between the new and old version of the game.
